Here we use Monte Carlo simulations based on expert knowledge. This is a well-established and flexible method for decision modeling. Allowing for use of expert-derived probabilities and variances to estimate outcomes, even when data is sparse. Capture the variability and uncertainty in model inputs. Guide decision-making by identifying likely outcomes and their variability.

# Generalized Function 

```{r child="Generalized_function.Rmd"}
```

# Prior Estimates 

```{r child = "Prior_estimates.Rmd"}
```

# Example Use Case Bidens pilosa

```{r child="Bidens_Pilosa.Rmd"}
```

# Decision model 

```{r child = "Decision_model.Rmd"}
```

# Update based on field observations

```{r child = "Update.Rmd"}
