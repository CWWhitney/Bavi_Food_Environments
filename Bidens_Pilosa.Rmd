For a conservation project, this function will be used to simulate the effects of different park management strategies (e.g., restricting access, providing seedlings) on:

- Species conservation: Probability of preserving species.
- Dietary diversity: Impact on local food systems.
- Expenditure: Financial cost to the park service.
- Cultural heritage: Loss of traditional knowledge.

By comparing the simulated outcomes for each strategy, decision-makers can identify trade-offs and prioritize actions. The function can handle multiple decision options and outcomes with ease. It incorporates expert-defined variability_list distributions for outcome variability. It also explicitly separates decision logic, outcome effects, and variability_list, ensuring clarity and reproducibility. For each decision option and outcome, the function calculates the **Outcome Value** using the following formula:

\[
\text{Outcome Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Decision}_i \times \text{Weight}_i + \text{variability_list}
\]

Where

- \(\text{Decision}_i\): A binary value (\(1\) or \(0\)) indicating if the \(i\)-th decision is active.
- \(\text{Weight}_i\): The influence of the \(i\)-th decision variable on the outcome.
- \(\text{variability_list}\): A random term representing variability or uncertainty, specific to the outcome and decision, as defined by the `variability_list`.
