# Bavi forest access model - sustainable food environments

Model of the park decision to allow access to forest foods in Bavi Park

Vietnam's national parks are managed by Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development through Vietnam's Forestry Administration VNForest. We are designing a project to assess the possibility for co-management of the forest for collecting wild food. Supporting the conservation of the buffer zone and sustainable food environments and nutrition for local communities.
